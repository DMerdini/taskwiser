    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to be simple and secure, leveraging path-based ownership for user profiles and a flat collection for tasks. This structure promotes authorization independence and efficient querying.\n\n1.  **User Profiles:** Stored in `/users/{userId}`, providing straightforward ownership-based security.\n2.  **Tasks:** Stored in a single `/tasks/{taskId}` collection. Each task contains the `userId` of its owner. While this collection is flat, it is secured by rules that enforce `userId == request.auth.uid` for creation and modification, fulfilling the QAP by preventing unauthorized access.\n3. **Departments**: Stored in a flat `/departments/{departmentId}` collection to manage organizational units.\n\nThis design avoids complex subcollections or hierarchical dependencies, making the security rules easier to understand, debug, and maintain.  It relies on denormalization of the `userId` within the `Task` entity to maintain authorization independence and enable secure list operations."
